# weatherAppProject

This is a project to create a weather website, using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, that uses an API to source weather information.
This is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIYQR-Ybrn4).

## Additional features

- Functionality added for the user to use the enter key to trigger the weather check for the entered city.

### Still to come
- Responsiveness so that this displays nicely on screen sizes other than small (phones).
- Would be nice to display the wind direction, maybe by rotating the wind image.
